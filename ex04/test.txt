My character's like half and half. Who knows?
A public figure's striving life. Who knows?
Abstaining from large cravings. Who knows?
Always out of breath for daydreaming. Who knows?

Wanna cry in peace, I know
Wanna party like crazy, I know
Wanna be fluttered with love, I know
Ye I know I know I know, Cause Me

Y'all must've been caught like fish
In a net called 'desire' with thirst in life
Common psychological escape
Even I can't swim out of it

Not, a reality refusal
Discontent, misfitting
Ain't none of that
Love ma rule

For once I want a different picture in my life
That I want to draw, a canvas dream

Beyond that boundary line over there
Let's feel it
Like the hole Alice fell into
Like the road that leads to Hogwarts
It'll be a world of mirages

And it'll be all mine
It'll be exactly how I imagined
But it won't last forever
Shit

Wishing on a Sky
Wishing on a Scar
If there's the sun
I'd want to dream
Wishing on a Sky
Wishing on a Scar
If there's the moonlight
I wouldn't want to wake up

My
Daydream, Daydream (oh)
Daydream, Daydream (oh)
Daydream, Daydream (Ooh)
(Last)
Daydream, Daydream (Eeh)

So what I get drunk
Until I go crazy
So what I go out
Don't think about work

Let's just feel the youth
Young Wild and Free
Wild and Free
Let me give it a try

No eggshell walking Errday
I do what I want with my feelings Errday
A love-expert sniping the heart when you fall in it Errday
Work out on my desire without a formula Errday

Ignore my character Errday
Wanna cry with no shame Errday
Dream list, the first priority
With no concerns on money
Deep sleep

Beyond that boundary line over there
Let's feel it
Like the hole Alice fell into
Like the road that leads to Hogwarts
It'll be a world of mirages

And it'll be all mine
It'll be exactly how I imagined
But it won't last forever
Shit

Wishing on a Sky
Wishing on a Scar
If there's the sun
I'd want to dream

Wishing on a Sky
Wishing on a Scar
If there's the moonlight
I wouldn't want to wake up

My
Daydream, Daydream (Oh)
Daydream, Daydream (Oh)
(Last)
Daydream, Daydream (Ooh)
Daydream, Daydream (Eeh)

If you ask me back
Why I dream
I'll sound like bragging
I'll put it down for a minute
To match my mechanism, Stay
I'll say that I'm getting some rest

What's this, What's this
Diving in the daydream, all the swimming is for me
Like this, like this
All my footsteps and my fantasy

If I want something
If I want something, Now
If I want something
If I want something, Now

That's a Daydream (They dream, They dream)
They dream, They dream (No, no no no no)

That's a Daydream (No, No, yeah)
Daydream Daydream (Daydream)
(Wake up)
